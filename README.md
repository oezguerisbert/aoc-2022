# Advent of Code and Learning Rust

Advent of Code is an annual programming challenge event created by Eric Wastl. Each day from December 1st to December 25th, a new programming puzzle is released, with two parts that build on each other. The challenges are self-contained and are designed to be solved using any programming language.

To participate in Advent of Code, you can sign up on the [event website](https://adventofcode.com/) and start solving the puzzles. As you solve each puzzle, you can submit your solution to the website and earn points based on how quickly you solve the puzzle. You can also compare your progress to other participants on the leaderboard.

Using Advent of Code to learn Rust is a great idea. Rust is a powerful and expressive programming language that is well-suited to solving complex problems. By participating in Advent of Code, you can learn Rust by solving a variety of challenging puzzles, and see how your skills improve as you progress through the event.

Here are some tips for using Advent of Code to learn Rust:

- Start with the first puzzle and work your way up. Each puzzle builds on the previous one, so starting from the beginning will help you learn the language and its features more effectively.

- Use the Rust documentation and community resources. Rust has [excellent documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/) and a friendly [community of users](https://users.rust-lang.org/) who are happy to help. If you get stuck, don't be afraid to ask for help on the [Rust forums](https://users.rust-lang.org/c/help) or on the [Advent of Code subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/).

- Practice, practice, practice. The more you practice using Rust, the better you will become at solving problems and expressing your ideas in the language. Solving the Advent of Code puzzles is a great way to build your skills and become proficient in Rust.

Good luck with your learning journey!
